Now we are going to start using git hub. Be patient it is simple but confusing :)

First, Navigate to /scratch/Shares/rinnclass/CLASS_2023/<your name>

# Let's clone the class git repository from GitHub

On the CLASS_2023 GitHub site, click the Code dropdown, select SSH
as your method on connecting and then click the clipboard icon which will
copy the url to your clipboard. You can then paste it here.

```{bash}

git clone <paste-ssh-link>

# Voila you are connected to our CLASS_2021 git repository.

# I will be updating .RMD files for class 
# To get the latest version simply go to the class git repository.
# Copy the text in the .RMD -- edit in class as you please.
# Then you will push those changes to your personal repository (see below).

```

In the real world you maybe collaborating with someone on a repository.
In this case you would use the command git pull

```{bash}

git pull

# Note that multiple people could make changes to the same file which results in conflicting versions.

# Nicely, git will not allow any commits to be pushed to the remote without asking you to resolve
# the conflicts between the two versions of a file.

# You can minimize the likelihood of having a file conflict if you `git pull` at the start of each session.

# You will not need git pull for this class -- rather copy and paste the latest version of the .RMD file

```

# making sure you get credit for your commits !

```{git bash}

# Open the command line.

# Set your username:
git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"

# Set your email address  **** this should be the same as the one associated with your git hub *****
git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"

# Now when you commit you will get credit on the github timeline for your contributions !!

```

Let's make some edits and make your first commit !!

Let's create a new file and type whatever, then we track that file using command
# git add

```{GIT BASH}

nano test.Rmd

# Type in something
# Save file

git status
git add test.Rmd
git status

```

Do you see a new item (test.Rmd) that git noticed was made and ready to sync?

Now we need to commit these changes that have been staged

```{GIT BASH}

git commit -m "Created a new test file."

```

sometimes you want to clone a repository and start working on it.
But if it is someone else's repository you won't have permissions (nor would you want them to :)
This is the case for class -- so we need to "push" our commited file to your repository (not the class)
```{GIT BASH clone repository and push to a different one}

# we will set where your commits go:
git remote set-url origin http://github.com/YOU/YOUR_REPO

# The "url that follows 'origin' is the ssh URL on the code button of your repository.

```

Ok let's update the github website from the terminal!

```{GIT BASH}

git status
git add test.Rmd
git commit -m "(put the notes you want on what was done inside the quotes)"
git push
# type git push again and you should see "up to date"

# !! Always remember to PUSH before you END a session !!
# !! Always remember to PULL before you START a session !!
```

# check out previous changes:

```{GIT BASH}

git log
git diff Xsum1 Xsum2

# if you run into trouble you can always delete a commit.
# For example if you delete your .gitignore file (see below)
# hundreds of files will be staged to be committed.

# to delete a given commit follow these commands:

git log
# find the "key" for the commit you want to delete.
git reset --hard "key"

```

This will show you all the changes -- you can also do this a bit more user friendly on git website.

Finally we need a text file titled ".gitignore" put all the file types you don't want to track. These are large files such as .csv or .pdf etc here are some examples


```{BASH}

touch .gitignore
nano .gitignore

# add extensions of files that are large (pdf, images etc)
# for this class copy and paste the following into .gitignore using nano
```

# Here are some other step by step instructions:
