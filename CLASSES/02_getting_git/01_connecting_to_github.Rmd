Our first objective today will be to sync to the class github. We will
go over a few needed things to establish git connections:

### Sign up for github -- if you already have nothing to do.


## FIRST STEP: set up ssh connection to github (one time only)

Navigate to your home directory on fiji ~/IDENTIKEY

```{bash}

cd ~
ls -lah

```

Note that there is a .ssh folder that you can place these unique keys to let
servers communicate securely. We can check to see if a key already exists.
If it doesn't we will generate one with the with ssh-keygen command.

Here we are connecting out "public key" on our server "Fiji" to github.
# If you want to connect your local computer there is also a .ssh file (MAC)

```{bash}
cd .ssh
ls -lah

# If it exists already, you can check out the public key using cat
cat id_rsa.pub

```


# Making a new RSA keygen if you don't already have one
```{bash}

ssh-keygen -t rsa

# Then cat the contents of the public key file (id_rsa.pub) and copy to clipboard.

```

Now let's got to your github website. 
You will need to sign into your github account first.

On the top right there is a drop down menu. 

Click on "Settings". Now you will see on the left side there is a list of options. 

Click on "SSH and GPG Keys" > "Add new key" on top right (green button). Paste in the new public SSH key we just generated.

# You may also want to go to your local computer shell .ssh folder (same place).
Generate a key and paste into github as done above. This way your local terminal
(not fiji server) can push to github too. Basically any machine(s) you want to
talk to github need this "handshake" SSH key.

Cool we are all connected !


# Setting up direct acess to fiji (no password needed anymore!)
```{BASH}

# We will be adding the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on FIJI.

# First: look to see if you have an id_rsa.pub in your .ssh folder (on your local computer)
# If you don't have one: You'll create a key on your local computer . 

# In windows you can use puttygen to create the key  
# Mac or Linux you can use ssh-keygen


# The instructions for creating a key with putty are here and detailed.
https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen

# The location of the key file should be in cd ~/.ssh for Mac and
# in Windows it should be in C:/Users/<username>/.ssh

# Then as above for github, you'll copy the public key to your clipboard
# and paste it into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on FIJI

nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Then paste in the key and save file.
# ctrl x, y to exit nano and save

# This will allow you to log-in to fiji without having to type your
# password in each time.


ssh identikey@fiji.colorado.edu 
# should connect directly with out a password 
```

There are often little bugs along the way we will fix.
Here is some good trouble shooting steps.
# trouble shooting
```{r}
# (***) check  push pull on Rstudio -- if grey doesn't know remote origin.

# From the start:

# (1) Go to GitHub and make repo - add a file (e.g. .readme)

# GO TO TERMINAL and project directory

# (2)  git remote add origin git@github.com:YOU/REPO_NAME.git
# Example - DON'T USE :) git remote add origin git@github.com:Boulderrinnlab/CODE_VAULT.git

# (3)  git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOU/REPO_NAME.git

# Example - DON'T USE :) git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Boulderrinnlab/CODE_VAULT.git

# (4) git pull

# (5) git push --set-upstream origin master 

```


# if you find that your commits are not being tracked by github it's likely that 
# the email you made the github account is different than CU boulder
# to get credit change git env email on fiji to the one used to start git hub







------------------Nice all connected to Git and Fiji ----------------------
