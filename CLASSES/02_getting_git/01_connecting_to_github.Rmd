Our first objective today will be to sync to the class github. We will
go over a few needed things to establish git connections:

### Sign up for github -- if you have already have nothing to do.


## FIRST STEP: set up ssh connection to github (one time only)
Navigate to your home directory on fiji ~/IDENTIKEY

```{bash}

cd ~
ls -lah

```

Note that there is a .ssh folder that you can place these unique keys to let
servers communicate securely. We can check to see if a key already exists.
If it doesn't we will generate one with the with ssh-keygen command.

Here we are connecting out "public key" on our server "Fiji" to github.
# If you want to connect your local computer there is also a .ssh file (MAC)

```{bash}
cd ~/
cd .ssh
ls -lah

# If it exists already, you can check out the public key using cat
cat id_rsa.pub

```


# Making a new RSA keygen if you don't already have one
```{bash}

ssh-keygen -t rsa
# just use the default name and no password needed
# Then cat the contents of the public key file (id_rsa.pub) and copy to clipboard.


# In windows you can use puttygen to create the key  
# Mac or Linux you can use ssh-keygen
# The instructions for creating a key with putty are here and detailed.
# https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen


```

Now let's got to your github website. 
You will need to sign into your github account first.

On the top right there is a drop down menu. 
Click on "Settings". Now you will see on the left side there is a list of options. 
Click on "SSH and GPG Keys" > "Add new key" on top right (green button). Paste in the new public SSH key we just generated.

# You may also want to go to your local computer shell .ssh folder (same place).
Generate a key and paste into github as done above. This way your local terminal
(not fiji server) can push to github too. Basically any machine(s) you want to
talk to github need this "handshake" SSH key.

Cool we are all connected !


# Setting up direct acess to fiji (no password needed anymore!)
```{BASH}

# We will be adding the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on FIJI.
# Then as above for github, you'll copy the public key to your clipboard
# and paste it into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on FIJI

nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Then paste in the key and save file.
# ctrl x, y to exit nano and save

# This will allow you to log-in to fiji without having to type your
# password in each time.


ssh identikey@fiji.colorado.edu 
# should connect directly with out a password 
```


--------- Nice we are all connected --------------



# {VERSION ONE cloning: start on your git hub site} 
Now let's clone the class git hub

# STEP 1: GO TO YOUR GIT HUB and make new repository called: CLASS_2023
You can leave empty

# STEP 2: clone in directory of choosing   
```{git bash}

# navigate to the directory of your choosing locally 
# On fiji
cd /scratch/Shares/rinnclass/CLASS_2023/<YOUR_NAME>

# NOW Clone via termial
git clone git@github.com:boulderrinnlab/CLASS_2023.git

# Cool so you can see all the class files now !!
# change directories into the new folder that was cloned
cd CLASS_2023/

```

# STEP 3 : initialize
```{git bash}

# simply type:
git init

# ok one step closer
```


# STEP 4: set up remote origin and url
```{git bash}

# setting up git origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:your_github/CLASS_2023.git
# git remote add origin git@github.com:rinntestsite/CLASS_2023.git

# setting up origin
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOU/REPO_NAME.git
# git remote set-url origin git@github.com:rinntestsite/CLASS_2023.git



git push --set-upstream origin master
```





git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOU/REPO_NAME.git

(5) git push --set-upstream origin master 



# trouble shooting
```{r}
# (***) check  push pull on Rstudio -- if grey doesn't know remote origin.



# From the start:





# (2)  git remote add origin git@github.com:YOU/REPO_NAME.git
# Example - DON'T USE :) git remote add origin git@github.com:Boulderrinnlab/CODE_VAULT.git

# (3)  git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOU/REPO_NAME.git

# Example - DON'T USE :) git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Boulderrinnlab/CODE_VAULT.git

# (4) git pull

# 

```


# if you find that your commits are not being tracked by github it's likely that 
# the email you made the github account is different than CU boulder
# to get credit change git env email on fiji to the one used to start git hub







------------------Nice all connected to Git and Fiji ----------------------
